These dinosaurs would appear on the learners’ mobile devices when they are in the vicinity. In another class, students may walk up to a table to see 3D models of multiple organs in the human body. Selecting an organ will reveal more information about it.',

		description:'The GeoCode project is inspired by the popular Geocaching app. Instead of using physical geocaches, QR codes (called geocodes) will be hidden and can be scanned by participants to view the contents of the discovered geocode. The project will consist of creating a mobile application that will allow users to track, scan, and virtually view geocodes. The platform will also include features such as leaderboards, virtual collectable and trackable objects, as well as time trials including a sequence of geocodes that can be discovered.',
